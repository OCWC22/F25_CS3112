Course
Description:
Methods for the design and analysis of correct and efficient computer algorithms; applications to
classical problems of searching, sorting, graph optimization, and combinatorial optimization.
Course Goals: At the end of the course, students can
1 Analyze the correctness and computational complexity of computer algorithms.
2 Design (specify and implement) efficient advanced Data Structures.
3 Know advanced design techniques and their nontrivial application to classic problems of
searching, sorting, graph optimization, and combinatorial optimization.
These course goals contribute to the success of Student Learning Outcomes 1.D, 2.D, 6.D,
and 6M.

Academic
Integrity:
Students are allowed and encouraged to discuss reading materials with each other. However,
homework assignments must be solved and written individually. If you obtain a solution with
help, then you should acknowledge your source in the paper and then write independently your
own solution. Cheating will not be tolerated. Cheating on any assignment or exam will be taken
seriously. All parties involved will receive a grade of F for the course and be reported to the
Academic Senate.
General Policies: Homework Assignments:
CS2148: All black and non-stared odd-numbered exercises.
CS3112: Homework will be assigned for each chapter. Homework is mandatory. Homework
assignments should be written or typed neatly on standard-sized paper (8.5 x 11 inches),
possibly in black or blue ink (please do not use red), and submitted at the due date through
Canvas. Each page should be numbered. Late submissions will not be accepted. You will not get
any homework credit if you miss four or more homework.
Final Exam: TBA. Please check GET for the day and time of the Final Exam.
Reasonable accommodation will be provided to any student who is registered with the Office of Students with
Disabilities and requests needed accommodation.
Academic honesty statement: Students are expected to do their own work and to abide by the University Policy
on academic honesty, which is stated in the Schedule of Classes. Copying the work of others, cheating on
exams, and similar violations will be reported to the University Discipline Officer, who has the authority to take
disciplinary actions against students who violate the standards of academic honesty.
Student Responsibilities: Students are responsible for being aware of all announcements that are made in class,
such as changes in exam dates, due dates of homework and papers, and cancellation of class due to the
instructor’s absence. Students are responsible for announcements made on days that they are absent.
Students must check their CSULA email account regularly for information from the instructor and the CS
Department. Failure to do so may result in missed deadlines or other consequences that might adversely affect
students. Note that you can forward this email account to any other account of your choosing.
NO MAKE-UP EXAMS, NO LATE HOMEWORK, AND NO INCOMPLETES!!!
NOTE: All exams are face-to-face.
